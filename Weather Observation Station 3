Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.

ans:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE ID % 2 = 0;

//We use % 2 because % is the modulus (remainder) operator.

What % 2 means

ID % 2 gives the remainder when ID is divided by 2.

How it helps here

Even numbers → remainder is 0

Example: 4 % 2 = 0, 10 % 2 = 0

Odd numbers → remainder is 1

Example: 5 % 2 = 1, 9 % 2 = 1
