Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

shortest city;

SELECT city,length(city) from station order by length(city), city limit 1;

longest city;

SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY
LIMIT 1;

//We use LIMIT 1 to make sure only one row is returned from the query.

Why it’s needed here

Your query orders the cities by length (and alphabetically for ties).
After sorting, the first row is the correct answer.

ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY
LIMIT 1;


//This means:

Sort cities by shortest length first

If lengths are equal, sort alphabetically

Pick the first row only
